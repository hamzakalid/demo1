00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.679
In today's fast-paced world, we are firm believers that there is no room for slow walkers.

2
00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:09.640
From that view, Obikon is surfaced as one of the most significant investment groups in

3
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.320
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

4
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.359
As we have carried out the responsibility to invest in our nation's future, and strive

5
00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:20.240
to achieve the ambitious goals and visions of its leaders since our inception in 1982

6
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.640
as a printing shop, we have been in a race against time to achieve our goal, to contribute

7
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.080
in advancing society as a medium of knowledge and information, and we were able to provide

8
00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.159
that in an environment that resonate with the memories of our clients, who trusted us

9
00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:34.320
since the beginning.

10
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.079
Our ambition as a printing press has been growing till we became a well-known publishing house.

11
00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.420
We are proud to publish more than 2900 cultural and methodological titles, and nearly 600

12
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.879
different authors in various fields of knowledge, which is what led us to assume the responsibility

13
00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.560
of developing and printing school curriculums for all levels of public education in the

14
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.079
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

15
00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.359
However, our vision of the future in Obikon goes even further, and that prompted us to

16
00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.839
allocate investments related to serving society through producing a high-quality packaging

17
00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.879
option that we have become today amongst the largest companies in the Middle East, in

18
00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:11.959
North Africa, with almost $1.6 billion in assets.

19
00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:16.799
3,000 employees and 25 companies based in 16 countries.

20
00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.640
And we have successfully ranked in the list of the top companies in the field of packaging

21
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.200
in various materials such as plastic, paper, and medium-density fiberboard panels with

22
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.920
more than 22 billion packs produced annually, which enabled us to serve various clients

23
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.840
within the Kingdom and abroad.

24
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.400
That made us the source of confidence for many of our customers, who we had the privilege

25
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.079
to provide with top-of-the-line services.

26
00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.799
We envision the future through digitalize, therefore keeping up with the digital transformation

27
00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.560
experience nowadays across the globe is highly essential.

28
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.560
We had enabled Obikon to establish a solid footprint in the digital solutions field by developing

29
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.159
several platforms catered to digitalize and streamline business activities, operating

30
00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.960
in diversified sectors including enterprise, human capital management, industrial, and logistics.

31
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.280
That was not the only turning point for Obikon.

32
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.240
Invading the public investment sector was another pivotal step that expanded our frontiers

33
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.680
of excellence.

34
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.439
We are keen on the quality of our production, so we launched in Obikon, a specialized company

35
00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:21.240
for technical fabrics, which is the type of premium-coded fabrics utilized for architectural

36
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.560
structures.

37
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.280
We are proud to be the only factory in the Middle East, producing this kind of coded

38
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.639
fabrics, whose production is exported to more than 60 countries around the world.

39
00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:35.400
This distinctive history of excellence gives us the privilege of serving the visitors

40
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.039
of the Holy House of Ala, through the construction and the production of fabrics, for more than

41
00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:45.120
40,000 tents and shades, distributed over the various holy sites in Maka, marking it the

42
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.480
first project of its kind in the world.

43
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.039
One of the most prominent accomplishments we are proud of is our launch of Obikon Glass,

44
00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:56.719
as one of the largest manufacturers of durable float glass in the Middle East, with production

45
00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:02.240
exceeding 800 tons per day of high-quality glass, and exports its production to more than

46
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.259
30 countries around the globe.

47
00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:09.120
As part of our social responsibilities, we are distinguished by a different approach.

48
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.879
We established the Riyadh Polytechnic Institute, which aims to build and develop a well-trained

49
00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:18.639
Saudi workforce, to contribute to the economic and cultural growth of our country.

50
00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:22.680
Ecologically, we believe that we should have a positive contribution that promotes a sustainable

51
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.280
and green environment.

52
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.000
Rafale environment was born from this sense of responsibility.

53
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.479
The company now treats over 250,000 tons of paper per year, and contributes to saving countless

54
00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:35.800
natural resources in landfills.

55
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.519
Our ambitions at Obikon knows no bounds, and we eagerly anticipate the near future.
